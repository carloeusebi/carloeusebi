# HELLO!!

## My name is Carlo Eusebi
I am a Full Stack developer with a strong expertise in the Laravel framework, complemented by advanced use of frontend technologies such as Vue and Nuxt.
My brief but intense experience in the development field has demonstrated my ability to work independently, delivering projects with speed and precision.
My extroverted nature, combined with calm determination, allows me to effectively integrate into work teams, promoting a collaborative and harmonious environment.
My passion for the industry enables me to stay consistently updated on the latest trends and autonomously expand my technical skills.
