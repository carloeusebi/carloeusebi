# HELLO!!

## My name is Carlo Eusebi

My journey into the world of programming began in high school, where I immediately developed a profound passion for it. I found programming to be an inherently natural fit, relishing every moment of debugging and problem-solving. Following high school, I briefly diverged from the programming path, working in local factories. However, my enthusiasm for coding was rekindled in 2023 when I discovered myself crafting scripts for video game mods.

This reawakening led me to make a pivotal career decision: to transform my passion for programming into my profession. In pursuit of this goal, I successfully completed the Boolean Full Stack Web Developer course in September 2023. Although I may be lacking extensive professional experience, I have cultivated a strong sense of autonomy in my work, underpinned by robust research, logical reasoning, and creative problem-solving skills.

Beyond my technical expertise, I've honed valuable social and teamwork abilities throughout my life. My successful participation in team-based sports and esports since my youth, as well as hands-on experience in the animation industry during the summer months, has helped me to develop my team and social skills.

My journey thus far has been marked by a deep passion for programming, a commitment to continuous growth, and a diverse skill set that extends beyond the world of code.
